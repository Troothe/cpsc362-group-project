We decided to create a mental health web application that helps the user meditate, journal, and track their thoughts.

The web application will consist of five web pages.  One to handle login and authentication, one which will act as a home screen and navigation menue, and then each of the three "pillars" mentioned will have its own webpage dedicated to that part of the application, and more details will be added here as the project progresses.
